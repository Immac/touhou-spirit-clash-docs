## Rules and Game Mechanics

### Objective: _All Stage Clear_

The objective of the game is to Clear 7 of your Opponent's Stages, 6 Main Stages and 1 Extra Stage. Each Player takes turns, developing their board and Knocking Out opposing Units, as well as completing Objectives in order to Clear Stages. Be careful though, each Stage that is Cleared grants the Player with access to more resources and options.

### Setup

To play the game you will need a deck composed of at least 60 Cards and a most 70 Cards. You may have up to 4 copies of cards with the same Name.

### Playing a Card
Cards come in the following Card Types:
1. **Unit** Cards: Characters and creatures that players can deploy onto the **Battlefield**, they usually interact with each other via **Combat** or with the game state via **Effects**. Ally Units may **Team Up** to form a **Team**, more on this later.
2. **Item** Cards: Items and inanimate objects, they can be placed on the field and used by **Units** by attaching them to the **Unit** or **Team**. They perfom on, or add **Effects** to the **Unit** or **Team**.
3. **Spellcard** Cards: **Spellcard**s perform effects listed on them.
4. **Stage** Cards: **Stage** Cards denote what **Stage** your opponent is currently trying to Clear. **Stage** cards may have **Effects** that impact the whole board, and grow more powerful in the later **Stage**s. **Stage** cards have their own separate *Deck*.

```
Note: At the moment of writting there is plans for 
Unit, Item, Spellcard and Stage cards.

Each player has a battle field, refer to the following picture for explanations.
