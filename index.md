## Welcome to Touhou Spirit Clash
- *Touhou Spirit Clash* is a Trading Card Game (TCG) that combines strategy, skill, and luck. Players build decks of cards representing various characters, spells, events, and equipment.

- Through the use of card abilities and mechanics, players can create powerful combinations and interactions. The game also incorporates artwork and flavor inspired by the Touhou universe

- The general flow of the game consists of summoning characters, activating effects and using mechanics to clear your opponent's stages and solve incidents. A player who runs out of stages loses; the last player standing wins.

## In Development

- Touhou Spirit Clash is in development, everything in the game is subject to change.

- At this moment, the [Card Maker](https://immac.itch.io/touhou-tcg-maker) is in development, you can visit the [devlogs on itch.io](https://immac.itch.io/touhou-tcg-maker) for more updates.

- For some early examples please visit [Pre Alpha](/pre-alpha-cards.md).

- The Game itself is intended as a physical card game. If there is interest for it I will be also making packages for simulators.

### Playing a Card
Cards come in the following Card Types:
1. **Unit** Cards: Characters and creatures that players can deploy onto the **Battlefield**, they usually interact with each other via **Combat** or with the game state via **Effects**. Ally Units may **Team Up** to form a **Team**, more on this later.
2. **Item** Cards: Items and inanimate objects, they can be placed on the field and used by **Units** by attaching them to the **Unit** or **Team**. They perfom on, or add **Effects** to the **Unit** or **Team**.
3. **Spellcard** Cards: **Spellcard**s perform effects listed on them.
4. **Stage** Cards: **Stage** Cards denote what **Stage** your opponent is currently trying to Clear. **Stage** cards may have **Effects** that impact the whole board, and grow more powerful in the later **Stage**s. **Stage** cards have their own separate *Deck*.

Note: At the moment of writting there is plans for Unit, Item, Spellcard and Stage cards.
