## Welcome to Touhou Spirit Clash
- *Touhou Spirit Clash* is a Trading Card Game (TCG) that combines strategy, skill, and luck. Players build decks of cards representing various characters, spells, events, and equipment.

- Through the use of card abilities and mechanics, players can create powerful combinations and interactions. The game also incorporates artwork and flavor inspired by the Touhou universe

- The general flow of the game consists of summoning characters, activating effects and using mechanics to clear your opponent's stages and solve incidents. A player who runs out of stages loses; the last player standing wins.

- Please visit the [Rules' Page](/rules.md) for more information.

## In Development
